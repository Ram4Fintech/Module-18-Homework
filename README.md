# Module-18-Homework

I initiated the following steps as required in this assignments

# Imports
All necessary libraries were imported

## Step 1:
I created the new dataclass Record and added the attributes 'sender', 'receiver' and 'amount' with their respective data types

## Step 2:
I renamed the 'data' attribute to 'record' and set it to use the instance of 'Record'
I defined the hash block (self) and after encoding it for record, creater id and timestamp, ran the sha update on each of these respectively. Similar actions were done on previous hash and nonce.
Then I created the class pychain with difficulty = 4. I defined proof of work and arroived at the calculated hash as the 'Winninh Hash'. Thereafter I defined the adding blaock function follopwed by validation of the block hashes to establish the validity of the Blockchain

## Step 3:
I added the user inputs to the streanlit interface for the input atreas of 'sender', 'receiver' and 'amount' and also added the 'Add Block' button functionality
Undder the PyChain Ledger heading, I specified the Block Difficulkty levels at 1,5 and 2. Coding were done to view the required blaock and also validate the pychain with streamlit button

## Step 4:
I tested the pychain ledger by Storing Records
